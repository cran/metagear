#' Detect and display all bar plot objects.
#'
#' Automated detection of grouped data displayed in a bar-plot/chart figure image.
#' The default returns these detected objects as an \code{EBImage} raster image, 
#' and as a vector of all the estimated lengths that are proportional to the values
#' presented on each bar (and their error bars, if they are present).  Note that
#' the extracted points will be sorted by their positioning on the X-axis (or 
#' Y if the plot is a horizontal bar plot).  For example, if there were error
#' bars in the figure these will be grouped with the detected bar column.  However,
#' within these X-axis positioning they will not be sorted.  See vignette for
#' worked several illustrations.     
#'
#' @param file The file name and location of a bar-plot figure.  Prompts
#'    for file name if none is explicitly called.
#' @param binary_threshold A proportion from zero to one designating the 
#'    gray-scale threshold to convert pixels into black or white.  Pixel
#'    intensities below the proportion will be converted to black, and those 
#'    above white.
#' @param horizontal If \code{TRUE} then aims to detect objects from a bar-plot 
#' that depicts data horizontally (rather than vertically).
#' @param axis_thickness An integer used to designate the thickness of the 
#'    axis lines on a figure.  Close alignment to the thickness of the axis
#'    on a figure will improve axis detection.
#' @param axis_sensitivity A value designating the sensitivity of identifying 
#'    straight lines on figure.  A smaller number results in a higher 
#'    sensitivity to identify axes.
#' @param axis_length The relative size of the axis to the figure.  The default
#'    is that axis lengths are 0.75 (75 percent) the size of the figure.  This 
#'    option is necessary since bar lengths may be similar to the axis length.  
#'    Values should range between zero and one.
#' @param axis_X_color The color to paint the detected X-axis.
#' @param axis_Y_color The color to paint the detected Y-axis.
#' @param Y_min The minimum Y value displayed on the Y-axis (used to scale
#'    detected data points).
#' @param Y_max The maximum Y value displayed on the Y-axis (used to scale
#'    detected data points).
#' @param bar_width An integer value designating the width of vertical lines on
#'    bars.  A smaller number should be used when the width of bars are 
#'    small (as well as the width of error bars).
#' @param bar_sensitivity A value designating the sensitivity of identifying 
#'    the vertical lines on bars.  A smaller number should be used when the
#'    thickness of bars are small (as well as the width of error bars).
#' @param point_color The color to paint the circles identifying the detected 
#'    levels on bar columns and error bars.
#' @param point_size An integer used to designate the size of the points painting
#'    the detected bars on a figure.  
#' @param ignore When \code{TRUE} does not display painted image with detections,
#'    only returns the data frame with detected points.
#'
#' @return A vector of scaled lengths for detected column and error bars.
#'
#' @export
