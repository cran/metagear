#' Splits a composite figure that contains multiple plots.
#'
#' Automatically detects divisions among multiple plots found within a single
#' figure image file.  It then uses these divisions to split the image into 
#' multiple image files; each containing only a single X-Y plot.  Currently only
#' works on composite figures that have a matrix-style presentation where each 
#' sub-plot has the same size.       
#'
#' @param file The file name and location of a composite figure.  Prompts
#'    for file name if none is explicitly called.
#' @param binary_threshold A proportion from zero to one designating the 
#'    gray-scale threshold to convert pixels into black or white.  Pixel
#'    intensities below the proportion will be converted to black, and those 
#'    above white.
#' @param space_sensitivity_X A proportion ranging from zero to one that 
#'    designates the size of the separation among sub-plots along the X-axis 
#'    relative to the largest empty space detected in the figure image.  As
#'    space_sensitivity_X approaches 1, finer empty spaces (e.g., empty spaces
#'    found in between plot captions and the axis line) will be treated as plot
#'    divisions.
#' @param space_sensitivity_Y A proportion ranging from zero to one that 
#'    designates the size of the seperation among sub-plots along the Y-axis 
#'    relative to the largest empty space detected in the figure image.  As
#'    space_sensitivity_Y approaches 1, finer empty spaces (e.g., empty spaces
#'    found in between plot captions and the axis line) will be treated as plot
#'    divisions.
#' @param border_buffer An integer value designating the amount of empty space
#'    around the figure image that should be ignored.  As the number increases,
#'    more blank space near the image's edge will be ignored. 
#' @param guess_limit An integer value designating the number of guesses for 
#'    within a figure image.  The default value designates the top 10 guesses of 
#'    divisions.  Increase this number if there are more than 6 subplots per axis.   
#' @param ignoreX When \code{TRUE}, ignores detection of sub-plots along the 
#'    X-axis.
#' @param ignoreY When \code{TRUE}, ignores detection of sub-plots along the 
#'    Y-axis.
#' @param quiet When \code{TRUE}, does not print to console the saved file names.
#'
#' @return The number of sub-plots saved to file.

#' @export
