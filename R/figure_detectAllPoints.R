#' Automated detection of plotted points from a scatter-plot figure image.
#'
#' Attempts to detect all points of a certain shape and size from a scatter-plot 
#' figure image (even those lying outside of the axis range).
#'
#' @param aBinaryPlot A binary figure image (an EBImage object).
#'    See: \code{figure_transformToBinary}
#' @param sensitivity A value designating the sensitivity of identifying unique
#'    points that overlap.  A smaller number results in a higher sensitivity to 
#'    split overlapping points; a larger number will extract only a single point
#'    from a cluster of overlapping points.
#' @param point_shape The shape of points on figure: can be \code{"circle"},
#'    \code{"square"}, or \code{"diamond"}.  If these options do not fit the
#'    shape found in a figure, use the option that best approximates that
#'    shape.
#' @param point_size An integer used to designate the size of the points on
#'    the figure.  Close alignment to the size of the points on a figure will
#'    improve point detection.  See \code{EBImage} to help determine which
#'    size to use.
#'
#' @return An \code{EBImage} object with detected scatter-plot points.
