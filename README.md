## metagear package

### purpose of the metagear package
**metagear** is a comprehensive, multifunctional toolbox with capabilities aimed to cover much of the research synthesis taxonomy: from applying a systematic review approach to objectively assemble and screen the literature, to extracting data from studies, and to finally summarize and analyze these data with the statistics of meta-analysis. More information about metagear can be found at [http://lajeunesse.myweb.usf.edu](http://lajeunesse.myweb.usf.edu).

### installation instructions and dependencies
**metagear** has an external dependency that needs to be installed and loaded prior to use in R. This is the **EBImage** R package (Pau et al. 2010) available only from the Bioconductor repository: https://www.bioconductor.org. 
To properly install **metagear**, start with the following R script that loads the Bioconductor resources needed to install the **EBImage** (also accept all dependencies):

``` r
install.packages("BiocManager"); 
BiocManager::install("EBImage")
library(metagear)
``` 

This dependency sometimes results in CRAN failing to generate a binary of **metagear** for your OS -- which sadly happens often. In this case install from the source, for example:

``` r
install.packages("metagear_0.7.tar.gz", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org", type = "source", dependencies = TRUE)
library(metagear)
```
