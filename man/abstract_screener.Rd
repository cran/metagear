  unscreenedValue = "not vetted",

}
\arguments{
\item{file}{The file name and location of a .csv file containing the
abstracts and titles.  The .csv file should have been initialized with
\code{effort_initialize} and populated with screeners (reviewers) using
\code{effort_distribute}.}

\item{aReviewer}{The name (a string) of the reviewer to screen abstracts.
It is used when there are multiple reviewers assigned to screen abstracts.
The default column label is "REVIEWERS" as initialized with
\code{effort_distribute}.}

\item{reviewerColumnName}{The name of the column heading in the .csv file
that contains the reviewer names that will screen abstracts.  The default
column label is "REVIEWERS".}

\item{unscreenedColumnName}{The name of the column heading in the .csv file
that contains the screening outcomes (i.e. vetting outcomes by a reviewer).
Unscreened references are by default labeled as "not vetted".  The
reviewer then can code to "YES" (is a relevant study), "NO" is not relevant
and should be excluded, or "MAYBE" if the title/abstract is missing or
does not contains enough information to fully assess inclusivity.
The default label of this column is "INCLUDE".}

\item{unscreenedValue}{Changes the default coding (a string) of "not vetted"
that designates whether an abstract remains to be screened or vetted.}

\item{abstractColumnName}{The name of the column heading in the .csv file
that contains the abstracts. The default label of this column is
"ABSTRACT".}

\item{titleColumnName}{The name of the column heading in the .csv file
that contains the titles. The default label of this column is "TITLE".}

\item{browserSearch}{Change the url for the browser title search; the
default is Google.}

\item{fontSize}{Change the font gWidgets::size of the title and abstract text.}

\item{windowWidth}{Change the default width of the GUI window.}

\item{windowHeight}{Change the default height of the GUI window.}

\item{theButtons}{A vector of coding buttons included on the screener. The
default is YES, maybe, and NO. Buttons can be removed as added by changing
this vector. For example, theButtons = c("YES", "NO") to remove the
maybe-button, or theButtons = c("YES", "maybe", NO", "model") to add a
"model" button that tags studies specifically as "model".}

\item{keyBindingToButtons}{A vector of specific keyboard bindings to buttons.
They are keyboard shortcuts to buttons and the default binding is y for
YES-button, m for maybe-button, and n for NO-button. If theButtons parameter
is modified then these keybindings should also be modified.}

\item{buttonSize}{Change the default gWidgets::size of buttons.}

\item{highlightColor}{The color of keywords highlighted in title and abstract.
The default is blue, but for classic yellow use "palegoldenrod".}

\item{highlightKeywords}{A string or list of keywords that will be highlighted
in title and abstract.}

A GUI screener to help scan and evaluate the title and abstract of studies to
be included in a systematic review or meta-analysis.

\note{
\strong{Installation and troubleshooting}\cr\cr For Mac OS users,
   installation is sometimes not straighforward as this screener requires the
   Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit to be installed. You can get this toolkit by making sure
   the latest X11 application (xQuartz) is installed, see here: 
   \url{https://www.xquartz.org/}. More information on
   installation is found in \code{metagear}'s vignette.
   \cr\cr \strong{How to use the screener} \cr\cr The GUI itself will appear
   as a single window with the first title/abstract listed in the .csv file.
   If abstracts have already been screened/coded, it will begin at the
   nearest reference labeled as "not vetted". The SEARCH WEB button opens the
   default browser and searches Google with the title of the reference. The
   YES, MAYBE, NO buttons, which also have keyboard shortcuts y and n, are
   used to code the inclusion/exclusion of the reference. Once clicked/coded
   the next reference is loaded. The SAVE button is used to save the coding
   progress of screening tasks. It will save coding progress directly to the
   loaded .csv file. \strong{Closing the GUI, and not saving, will result in
   the loss of screening efforts relative to last save.}  \cr\cr There is
   also an ISSUE FIXES menu bar with quick corrections to screening errors.
   These include ISSUE FIXES: REFRESH TITLE AND ABSTRACT TEXT which reloads
   the text of the current abstract in case portions were deleted when
   copying and pasting sections, ISSUE FIXES: STATUS OF CURRENT ABSTRACT
   which provides information on whether or not the abstract was previously
   screened, and ISSUE FIXES: RETURN TO PREVIOUS ABSTRACT that
   backtracks to the previous abstract if a selection error occurred (note a
   warning will appear of there is a change to its inclusion/exclusion
   coding).
